This bundle contains a version of javax.persistence that contains some updates that we are suggesting for JPA 2.0.  Specifically, the Persistence class has been modified to allow it to work in an OSGI Environment.

The JPA 1.0 persistence classes also work well with all our bundles when they are running in a non-OSGI environment.  They can be found in the lib directory at the base of the view.
